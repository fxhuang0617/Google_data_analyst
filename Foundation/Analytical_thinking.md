# How to use data to drive successful outcomes
- In business, data-driven decision-making can improve results in different ways.
- Data-driven decision-making increases your confidence in your decision and ability to address business challenges. It helps you to become more proactive when an opportunity presents itself, and it saves you time and effort when working toward a goal.

# Data life cycle
- Plan
  - We have to answer the following questions at this phase:
    - what kind of data does it need?
    - how it will be managed throughout its life cycle?
    - who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
  - In this phase we will plan what kind of data we want to capture.[Data type](https://github.com/fxhuang0617/Google_data_analyst/blob/main/Foundation/Analytical_thinking.md#quantitive-data-vs-qulitative-data)
  
- Capture
  - This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and 
brought into the organization.
  - Data might be from the outside resource like some public available dataset or just from the company's inside database.
- Manage
  - How we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the action taken to make sure that it'a maintained properly.
  - The phase is very important to data cleansing.
- Analyze
  - In this phase, the data is used to solve the problem, make great decisions, and support business goals.
- Archive
  - Archiving means to store data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.
- Destroy
  - Use a secure data erasure software.

# Six phases of data analysis
## It's a process rather than a life cycle.
- Ask
  - ask effective questions
    > use SMART to ask effective questions
    > 
    > S -> Specific : Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related idea
    > 
    > M -> Measurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed
    > 
    > A -> Action-oriented: Questions encourage change
    > 
    > R -> Relevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem youâ€™re trying to solve
    > 
    > T -> Time-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied
  - define the problem
  - use structure thinking
  - communication with others
- Prepare
  - understand  how data is generated and collected
  - identify and use different data formats, types, and structures
  - make sure data is unbiased and credible
  - organize and protect data
- Process
  - create and transform data
  - maintain data integrity
  - test data
  - clean data
  - verify and report on cleaning results 
- Analyze
  - use tools to fomat and transform data
  - sort and filter data
  - identify patterns and draw conclusions
  - make predictions and recommendations
  - make data-driven decisions 
- Share
  - understand visualization
  - create effective visulas
  - bring data to life
  - use data storytelling
  - communication to help othres undestand results
- Act
  - apply your insights
  - solve problems
  - make decisions
  - create something new
# Data analysis toolbox
## spreadsheets
### spreadsheets structure data in meaninful way by letting you
- Collect, store, organize, and sort information
- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts
## Database and query language
### A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery
### query languages 
- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis
## Visualization tools
### Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are ***Tableau*** and ***Looker***.
- Tableau's simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets 
- Looker communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you can choose
### A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like ***R*** and ***Python***, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.
# Choosing the right tool
| Spreadsheet | Databases |
|-------------|-----------|
|Software applications |Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL)|
|Structure data in a row and column format|Structure data using rules and relationship|
|Organize information in cells|Organize information in complex collections|
|Provide access to a limited amount of data|Provide access to huge amounts of data|
|Manual data entry|Strict and consistent data entry|
|Generally one user at a time|Multiple users |
|Controlled by the user |Controlled by a database management system|
# Reflection
## Comparing the data life cycle and data analysis phases
### The data life cycle aims to identify, verify, and transform the data. The data analysis process is like applying statistical approach to have insight from the data to help business make decisions. 
### For example, the Ask phase in analysis process is trying to ***identify the problems***. 
### In plan step, we are trying to ***know what kind of data we need, how to manage or store it, and who should be responsible for it***.
